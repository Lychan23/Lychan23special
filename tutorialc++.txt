Level 1: Introduction to C++

Basics of C++: Overview of the C++ programming language, including variables, data types, operators, control structures (if-else, loops), functions, and basic I/O.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts: Introduction to OOP principles such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Arrays and Strings: Working with arrays and string manipulation in C++.
Pointers: Understanding pointers, memory allocation, and pointer arithmetic.
Dynamic Memory Management: Introduction to dynamic memory allocation using new and delete operators.
File Input/Output: Reading from and writing to files using file streams.

Level 2: Intermediate C++

Advanced Data Types: Detailed exploration of advanced data types such as structures, unions, enumerations, and typedefs.
Standard Template Library (STL): Overview of the STL containers (vector, list, map, etc.), algorithms, and iterators.
Exception Handling: Handling and throwing exceptions to manage errors and exceptional situations in code.
Templates: Understanding function templates and class templates to create generic algorithms and data structures.
Operator Overloading: Implementing custom behavior for operators using operator overloading.
Namespaces: Organizing code into logical units using namespaces.
Advanced OOP: In-depth coverage of advanced OOP concepts like virtual functions, abstract classes, interfaces, and multiple inheritance.

Level 3: Advanced C++

Smart Pointers: Exploring smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr) for automatic memory management.
Move Semantics: Understanding move semantics and rvalue references for efficient resource management.
Lambda Expressions: Working with lambda expressions for concise code and functional programming paradigms.
Multithreading: Introduction to multithreading in C++ using thread objects, synchronization mechanisms, and thread safety.
Regular Expressions: Utilizing regular expressions to search, match, and manipulate text.
C++ Standard Library Extensions: Overview of additional features introduced in newer C++ standards (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20).
Performance Optimization: Techniques for optimizing C++ code, including profiling, benchmarking, and code optimization strategies.
