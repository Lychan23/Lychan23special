# Security Policy

# Security

At [Lychan23special], we take security seriously. We strive to ensure that our code and users' data are protected from potential threats. This document outlines the security practices we follow and provides guidance for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly. Please follow these guidelines when reporting security issues:

- **Do not** publicly disclose the issue until we have addressed it.
- - Submit your report to issues 
- Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the steps to reproduce it.
- If possible, include any relevant technical details, such as the affected versions, components, or configuration settings.
- Once the vulnerability has been resolved, we will credit your contribution if desired, highlighting your responsible disclosure.

## Secure Development Practices

We follow a set of secure development practices to minimize the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities into our codebase. These practices include:

- Regularly updating and patching dependencies to address known security issues.
- Conducting code reviews to identify and address security-related flaws.
- Adhering to secure coding guidelines and best practices for each supported programming language.
- Implementing secure authentication mechanisms, such as password hashing, token-based authentication, or OAuth.
- Applying secure communication protocols, including TLS/SSL encryption for data transmission.
- Performing regular security assessments, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
- Monitoring logs and system behavior to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
- Staying informed about the latest security threats and vulnerabilities in the development community.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We are committed to addressing and resolving security vulnerabilities promptly. To promote responsible disclosure, we ask that you adhere to the following policy:

- **Do not** attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the security issue.
- Do not access, modify, or delete data from other users without their explicit permission.
- Do not share or publicize any sensitive data or personally identifiable information (PII) obtained through a security vulnerability.

We appreciate your cooperation in keeping our project secure. By following these guidelines, we can work together to protect our users and maintain the integrity of the codebase.

## Security Updates

We will provide updates on security-related matters, such as bug fixes, patches, or changes in security practices, through our official communication channels. It is recommended that you stay informed and apply any updates promptly to ensure the security of your deployment.
